**Contributions**:

  **Jacob Porter**
  1. Centralized all additions required for submittion of Project Proposal Document in said document for next team meeting. Began creating the Project Presentation slides. Updated Trello with current project "To do" requirements. Updated GitHub with version of Project Proposal Document and "reports" subdirectory with this report (20250116.md).
  2. Updating CSS via and extension is a bit tricky because I've had to look through multiple pages of Cavas HTML to find out which tags/ids/classes I need to overwrite. I've gone through multiple iterations of injecting the CSS to find "the best way", but it's been veery time consuming with little return. I've gotton some css to be adjusted, but have much more to do.
  3. Try and complete CSS injection the Home, Modules, and Syllabus pages so they look good (3 days)

1. Week 3/4 goals: Show up to classes and team meetings. Contribute to the Project script // Get weekly report completed.
2. Overall, I communicated a good amount to the team, but in general, my contributions lacked. I'd have liked to do more work for the team; this week I got carried by everyone else.
3. Next week: Contribute more to the team, and go above and beyond to make up for previous weeks. Complete research for Canvas API, and present to the team my findings about how we can connect and use Canvas information with our extension.
