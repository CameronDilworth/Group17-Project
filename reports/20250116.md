**Team Report**
  1. *week 1, empty*
  2. We've continued to work on the Project Proposal and overall Project idea; refining and developing the MVP we wish to create. We've also began creating the first Project Presentation which is including these newer and more refined ideas. No software development has started yet, but research and planning has so we can *hit the ground running* next week.
  3. Goals for next week: Complete Project Proposal (2 hours), Complete Project Presentation (45 min), Split up project responsibilites (10 mins), Determine weekly meeting time (10 min), Complete *(at least)* 1 feature that passes a user test (3 days)
